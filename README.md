MacOS sample calculator done for a job interview @ TechSmith

This programming assignment is for a simple calculator.

The original version of the UI that I did had a disabled/dimmed "." button as the project instructions specified only whole numbers could be used.  But I couldn't avoid seeing decimals in the calculator window, as some division operations will end up with non-whole numbers.

I replaced the dimmed "." button with a "C"-Clear key at the very end of programming.
